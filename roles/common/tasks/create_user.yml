    # - name: install systemd-container package for machinectl
    #  so this is the new way to switch users with a clean login environment
    #  has to do with changes to systemd and its vm & container handling
    #  but its not simple to remember:
    #  https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/346841/\
    #  why-does-sudo-i-not-set-xdg-runtime-dir-for-the-target-user
    #  e.g. # machinectl shell --uid=$(id -u user)
    #  so for now I'm leaving the cheap fix of exporting the XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
    #  in .bashrc on login
